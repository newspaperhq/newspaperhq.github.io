# [Newspaper](http://www.newspaper.io) - Level up your knowledge

This is the main site for newspaper which uses Jekyll. 
Github builds Jekyll sites for you automatically but to run this locally `bundle install` 
then `jekyll serve`

Newspaper scours the web for the most relevant content for the topics you are interested in and sends you a daily digest of content that is really relevant.
We have relaunched as a app for Slack
